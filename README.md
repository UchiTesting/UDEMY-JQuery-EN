==========================================================

Codes from to the jQuery course from Pablo Farias Navarro on Udemy.  
It is provided as content from the course. This content was not coded
by myself and is here for reference.
Anything I would add to this repository is in the Extra folder.
The added value to this repository is the personal notes I took.
They are written with MarkDown and available in the `Extra/md` folder through the [Notes.md](Extra/md/Notes.md) file.
